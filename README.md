# College evaluation project:

We are ShareCrabb consulting, a fictitious firm hired by the world famous (fictitious) Chris Jenkins foundation.
Jenkins has entrusted us with choosing a college to recieve his enormous yearly donation.

## Core evaluation metric:
<p> Our evaluation metric will be the school's grade-points-per-credit system  </p>

</ol>

### The ShareCrabb gameplan:

	<li>We will query the database to find information relating to Jenkins's criteria</li>
	<li>We will perform hypothesis testing to evaluate the significange of the school in relation to our criteria</li>
	<li>We will give a final recommendation</li>
</ol>
